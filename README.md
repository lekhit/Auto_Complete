## Overview

The Intelligent Sentence Search Engine is an AI-powered search system designed to efficiently search and retrieve sentences based on user queries. It utilizes Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and A* search algorithms for optimized search results. The system is capable of learning from user interactions, adapting to search patterns, and dynamically scaling to handle varying workloads.

## Features

- **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO):** Initial search optimization using PSO to efficiently explore the search space.

- **A* Search Algorithm:** Utilizes A* search for further refinement and optimization of search results.

- **User Learning:** Learns from user interactions to adapt to search patterns and improve the search experience over time.

- **Biasing for Search Term:** Handles biasing for search terms during the construction of the initial search tree.

- **Auto Scaling:** Dynamic scaling to handle varying workloads and adapt to changing requirements.

- **Horizontal Scaling:** Enables scaling horizontally to distribute the workload and improve system performance.

- **Real-time Search Term Addition:** Allows users to add search terms on-the-fly for a more personalized search experience.

- **Caching:** Speeds up search by caching previous search results for frequently used queries.

- **Global Frequency Tracking:** Keeps track of the global frequency of searches to adapt to changing trends and requirements.
